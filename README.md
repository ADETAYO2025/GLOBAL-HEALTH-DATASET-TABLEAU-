## 🌍 Global Health Dataset (Tableau)  
**Tools:** Tableau (Dashboards, Filters, Interactive Visualizations)  
**Dataset:** Gapminder Health  

As a Data Analyst for a global health organization, I created a series of Tableau visualizations to highlight health disparities and trends across countries and continents.  

### 🔹 Key Deliverables  
1. **Life Expectancy by Continent (Most Recent Year):**  
   - Bar chart showing average life expectancy by continent.  
   - Filtered to the latest year available.  

2. **Life Expectancy Trend Over Time (Top 5 Countries):**  
   - Line chart of life expectancy trends.  
   - Filtered for the top 5 countries with the highest average life expectancy.  

3. **Population Distribution by Gender (Latest Year):**  
   - Pie chart showing gender-based population split.  
   - Interactive filter to select countries.  

4. **Health Metric Comparison (Scatter Plot):**  
   - Scatter plot comparing average Life Expectancy vs BMI.  
   - Countries represented as data points, colored by continent.  

5. **Additional Visualization:**  
   - Created a custom chart to provide another perspective on global health metrics.  

6. **Dashboard Creation:**  
   - Combined all worksheets into an interactive **"Global Health Dashboard"**.  
   - Added country filters for easy comparison across charts.
